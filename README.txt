Class number: 335
Project:#1 Cella Rule 90
Team Name: NFG - Jonathan Ishii, Matthew Mikulka

Intro:
How our Cella Rule 90 was implemented:

We created a 2040 by 2030 canvas that we set up a grid we broke down into a 400 by 400 squares and labeled accordingly. we then used a 2D array in Javascript to record the placement of black cells. When we find a cell that should be black we find the index in the 2D array and draw a 5x5 black pixel box at the corresponding grid location to mark the cell.

How to show (and run) the web page:
1. Drag and drop the "cella rule 90.html" file onto a browser to see what it does, or double click on it and it will launch in your default browser.

Features:
Draws a 400x400 grid that implements the Cella rule 90 with an initial active cell at the 200th box.

Bugs:
none
